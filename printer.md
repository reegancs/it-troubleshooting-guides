## Printer Troubleshooting Guide

# 1. Make sure the printer is turned on
Check that the power cable is plugged in securely and that the display screen or lights are on.

# 2. Check the connection
If you’re using a USB printer, make sure the cable is firmly plugged into both the printer and your computer.
For wireless printers, check that it’s connected to the correct Wi-Fi network.

# 3. Confirm it’s the default printer
Open your computer’s printer settings and make sure the right printer is set as the default.

# 4. Look for paper jams or low ink
Open the printer cover, clear any jams and check the ink or toner levels.

# 5. Restart everything
Turn the printer off, wait a few seconds and then turn it back on. Restart your computer as well.

# 6. Update or reinstall the driver
Download the latest driver from the printer manufacturer’s website and install it.

# 7. Get extra help
If none of these steps work, contact your IT team or the printer manufacturer for more support.
