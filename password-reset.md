## Password Reset Troubleshooting Guide

# 1. Click “Forgot Password”
Enter your username or email when asked, then check your email or phone for the code they send you.

# 2. Answer security questions or use recovery options
If asked, fill in your security questions or choose to get a code sent to your backup email or phone number to reset your password.

# 3. Use your organization’s password portal
If this is for work or school, go to the official password reset page your IT department provides.

# 4. Try signing in from a different device
Sometimes cached login information causes problems. If it still won’t work, login from a different phone or computer and try there.

# 5. Contact IT support
If all else fails, contact your IT helpdesk. You will likely need to verify your identity before they manually reset your account.
