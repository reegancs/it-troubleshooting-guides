## Slow PC Troubleshooting Guide

# 1. Close programs you aren’t using
Too many apps or browser tabs being left open can slow your computer down. After you have saved your work, close down anything you don’t need.

# 2. Restart the computer
Doing a restart will fix temporary issues and will often make things run faster.

# 3. Uninstall unused programs
Go to your computer’s settings and remove old or unnecessary apps that take up space and memory.

# 4. Check for updates
Install the latest Windows or macOS updates. They often include fixes that can improve performance.

# 5. Run a malware scan
Viruses and malware can make your PC run slower. Use Windows Security or another reputable antivirus software to run a quick scan.

# 6. Clear temporary files
Use the built-in disk cleanup tool to remove unnecessary temporary files and free up space.

# 7. Ask IT for help
If the PC is still slow after these steps, contact IT support. There could be a hardware problem that needs fixing.
